### Hey there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently studying at Zone01 Rouen, Normandy, in order to become a full stack developper.
To this end, I'm also looking for an apprenticeship and start working in dev "for real". 

### Training
To this day, I've been learning code mostly with C# (via the <a href="https://learn.unity.com/">Unity Learn </a> program), front-end online courses (with <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/">OpenClassrooms </a>), 
and recently GO and Javascript (vanilla), since I joined Zone01. Currently, I'm just begining learning React and other frameworks 
commonly used in the dev industry.
