### Hello there fellow developers üëã (we're on git, after all)
My name is Aubry Varen, and I'm currently studying at <a href="https://zone01normandie.org/">Zone01 Rouen </a>, Normandy, in order to become a full stack developer.
To this end, I'm also looking for an apprenticeship and to start working in dev "for real". 

### Training
To this day, I've been learning code mostly with C# (via the <a href="https://learn.unity.com/">Unity Learn </a> program), front-end (HTML, CSS, jQuery) online courses (with <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/">OpenClassrooms </a>), 
and recently GO and Javascript (vanilla), since I joined Zone01. Currently, I'm just begining learning React and other frameworks 
commonly used in the dev industry. 

### What I'm looking for
I'm currently trying to find the company in which I will be able to keep learning and be a part of something that's bigger than myself.

### More about me
As long as I can remember, I was a big fan of video games. I was something like 10 when Final Fantasy 7 came out in Europe, which was my very first great adventure.
For many years after that, I've been playing games and living many other of these adventures. It was only later, after several years working in the pharmaceutical industry,
that I realized I was not happy with my job and I wanted to see what was "behind the scenes" of a video game. It's how I discovered programming and a whole new universe along with it,
much bigger than the video game industry itself, much bigger than I could even imagine back then. 

Of course, video games will always be a part of my life and i'll keep exploring this domain (at least by myself), but i'm eager to discover others as well.
That is why I decided to embark for the Full-Stack Developer trip, and see where it takes me üó∫Ô∏èüß≠
